## Keep track of things you forgot
(1) the syntax to sync a stylesheet to an html page
(2) the components of an html form
(3) how to use the Request Fetch constructor

## Retrospective
- Got stuck on the new Request constructor that is provided by the Fetch API
- Frustrating because since my familiarity waned, 
  I couldn't get to the meat of the problem.
- TODO: review how to Post forms using the Fetch API, and practice.
